This was a project I started back in late 2024, to centralize a lot of functions that I used in my projects into one repository. But I was new to Dart, so I had no idea about a lot of things, like enums and named parameters. So I abandoned this version to move on to version 2, at [Calebh101/localpkg-flutter-2](https://github.com/Calebh101/localpkg-flutter-2).

Trust me, you do *not* want to look in version 1's code.
