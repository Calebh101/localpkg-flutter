# Personal @ localpkg

## Why?

This is a package I use to keep all my global tools in one place. On all my machines, I keep this at /localpkg so it works on my main Linux computer, my side iMac 2011 that I upgraded so I can build to iOS. I will dual-boot or VM into Windows to build to Windows, but **A** that's not my biggest priority and **B** I don't know how to implement /localpkg as a package path on Windows.

## What does it have?

It has some basic stuff like input verification and alert dialogues, stuff that I only want to build once. Feel free to use it, but I won't be adding documentation, examples, changelogs, or official support for this package.
