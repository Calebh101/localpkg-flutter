## Why?

This is a Flutter package I made to keep all my global tools in one place.

To use, include this in pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
dependencies:
    localpkg:
        git:
            url: https://github.com/Calebh101/localpkg-flutter.git
            ref: main
```

## What is "personal"?

"personal" was the name of the package before I renamed it to "localpkg". It was referenced as localpkg before this, but the pubspec.yaml name was "personal".

## What does it have?

It has some basic stuff like input verification and alert dialogues, stuff that I only want to build once. Feel free to use it, but I won't be adding documentation, examples, changelogs, or official support for this package.
